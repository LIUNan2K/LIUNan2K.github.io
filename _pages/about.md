Hello, welcome

I'm currently a Master student at the School of Cyber Science and Engineering, [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/) (XJTU), advised by Prof. [Zhou Su](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KDbnu2cAAAAJ). I'm also very lucky to receive the guidance of Prof. [Tom H. Luan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lPDUfpgAAAAJ), Prof. [Yuntao Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=90fr-8wAAAAJ), and Prof. [Yiliang Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=beCuvCwAAAAJ). Prior to this, I obtained my B.E. in Information Engineering at XJTU in 2022.

My research mainly focuses on distributed decision-making (*e.g.*, game theory and multi-agent reinforcement learning) in stochastic, dynamic, and large-scale environments, with applications in communication networks (*e.g.*, edge computing and resource allocation in Metaverse networks). Besides, I'm also interested in other topics, such as distributed machine learning, LLM agent, *etc.*

You can find my CV [here](../assets/CV.pdf).
